# Plexus Chuck

![alt text](docs/images/cn-approved.png)

**Plexus Chuck** is a sample baseline project which aims to show a standard state-of-the-art proposal for Android development in Plexus.


## Installation
Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**

##### Clone with SSH
```bash
> git clone git@repo.plexus.services:desarrollo/mobile-playground/plexus-chuck.git
```

##### Clone with HTTPS
```bash
> git clone https://repo.plexus.services/desarrollo/mobile-playground/plexus-chuck.git
```


## Generating signed APK
From Android Studio:
1. ***Build*** menu
2. ***Generate Signed APK...***
3. Fill in the keystore information *(you only need to do this once manually and then let Android Studio remember it)*


## Login
After the initial splash, a login/register screen displays. To get access, use the following credentials:

`User: pablo.sordomartinez@plexus.es`

`Password: plexu5`


## Architecture and project organization
To address this sample app development, the team has decided to employ a class hierarchy based on the [**Clean Architecture**](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) paradigm, a concept with an increasing popularity thanks to Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

### Class hierarchy
Among the different implementations for Android applications of the aforementioned paradigm, there are remarkable contributions such as the ones from [Antonio Leiva](https://antonioleiva.com/clean-architecture-android/) and [Fernando Cejas](https://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/). Precisely, this latter work has served as the main inspiration for this application architecture.

Therefore, the prior idea behind **Plexus Chuck** is concern-layers separation. Each of this entities is in charge of certain responsibilities, which are handled in isolation. These layers get interconnected thanks through interfaces, which allow to achieve the necessary abstraction between them.

* **Presentation**
This layer's duties consist of managing the events caused by the user interactions, and rendering the information coming from the _domain_ layer. In this particular case, the team has opted for using the Model-View-ViewModel ([MVVM](https://proandroiddev.com/mvvm-architecture-viewmodel-and-livedata-part-1-604f50cda1)) architecture pattern. This entity "sees" the _domain_ layer.

* **Domain**
This layer is in charge of the application business logic. It is built upon _use-cases_ and repositories (_repository pattern_). The _domain_ layer obtains data from the _data_ module, use them to perform all the required operations, and format the outcomes to later deliver them to the _presentation_ layer. This entity only contains Kotlin code, and thus testing should only consist of **Unit Tests**. This layer represents the most inner entity, and thus it does not "see" anyone but itself.

* **Data**
This layer simply contains libraries and frameworks which provide data to the application (data sources). Among them, stand out service-query frameworks (_Retrofit_), local databases (_Room_), events tracking (_Omniture_), etc. This layer "sees" the _domain_ layer.

The usage of this class hierarchy and package organization pursues grasping the **SOLID** principles, getting more flexible when implementing new functionality, and easing code testing.
 
### Inversion of Control
In order to facilitate the interaction between the above described layers, Plexus Chuck uses a service locator. **[Koin](https://www.raywenderlich.com/9457-dependency-injection-with-koin)** is a framework which allows to abstract type injection in a neat and clear manner. 

### Coroutines
Since _multithreading_ has historically been a challenge in Android Development, the team has decided to include [coroutines](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/#0). This is one of the most interesting and appealing features recently introduced in Kotlin.

The main advantage that supports the usage of _coroutines_ is an easy and enhanced multithreading management. _Coroutines_  allow to turn asynchronous operations in synchronous code, without affecting the application overall performance.

From the _execution-flow_ perspective, every task is undertaken in the main thread (UI thread), until a _use-case_ is invoked. From that moment onwards, operations are handled in worker threads, to later retrieve the computed results in the main thread again.

## Documentation
The documentation is managed in two different ways:
* Using this **README.md** file to give a quick overview of the project.
* Using **dokka**, which is a framework for Kotlin projects, similar to Javadoc.

For the latter, the documentation can be find in the *docs/dokka* folder, organized in modules. To generate it, simply run the next command from a terminal:
```bash
> ./gradlew dokka
```  

When finished, open up `index.html` using your favourite browser.
